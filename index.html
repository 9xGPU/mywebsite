      <p1 style="color:black;">I am a tech nerd who sits at his computer all day and plays games and looks at Reddit. I have other interests/hobbies including British stuff but I am from America, data nerd, Doctor Who, and more. Mr. TechBy7E is also pretty good at Excel and other Office programs and is a computer genius. 
        I like the color blue but light blue is much better.</p1><br>
